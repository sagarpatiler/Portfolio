# PROJECT NOTEBOOK


# [Project :Sales Prediction](https://github.com/sagarpatiler/machine_learning/blob/main/Sales_Prediction.ipynb) 
* Created a model that can predict sales with help of XgboostRegressor.
* feature columns were Item_Identifier, Item_Weight, Item_Fat_Content, Item_Visibility,Item_Type, Item_MRP,Outlet_Identifier,Outlet_Establishment_Year, Outlet_Size, Outlet_Location_Type,Outlet_Type, Item_Outlet_Sales
* Missing value treatment with mean value for numerical columns and with mode with categorical columns.
* Used python libraries like Sklearn,pandas,seaborn,matplotlib.pyplot
* Evaluation with the help of R2.

# [Project :Bank Loan Status Prediction](https://github.com/sagarpatiler/machine_learning/blob/main/Banks_1_loan_status_prediction.ipynb) 
* Created a model that can predict loan status with help of XgboostRegressor.
* feature columns selected  were -Gender,Married,Dependents,Education,Self_Employed,ApplicantIncome,CoapplicantIncome,LoanAmount,Loan_Amount_Term,Credit_History,Property_Area, Loan_Status.
* As missing values were less in number just dropped those values.
* Plotting was done with the help of libraries such as seaborn,matplotlib.
* Parameter tuning was done with help of GridSearchCV
* Accuracy was found to be  0.833333

# [Project :Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/sagarpatiler/machine_learning/blob/main/car_price_prediction_.ipynb) 
* Linear Regression Model was created.
* R squared score  was found to be  0.8833249177813693.
* Dependent features were - Car_Name,Year,Selling_Price,Present_Price,Kms_Driven,Fuel_Type,Seller_Type,Transmission 
* Dataset did not have missing values.
* Libraries such as sklearn,seaborn,matplotlib were used.

# [Project :Gold Price Prediction](https://github.com/sagarpatiler/machine_learning/blob/main/gold_price_prediction.ipynb) 
* RandomForestRegressor Model was used for the purpose of linear regression problem.
* Shape of the data was (2290, 6)
* R squared score  was found to be 0.9872775170838556.
* Dependent features were - SPX,USO,SLV,EUR/USD 
* Libraries such as sklearn,seaborn,matplotlib were used.

# [Project :Diamond Price Prediction](https://github.com/sagarpatiler/machine_learning/blob/main/diamond_price_pred_pyc.ipynb)

* Shape of the data was (2290, 6)
* R squared score  was found to be 0.9872775170838556.
* Dependent features were - SPX,USO,SLV,EUR/USD 
* Libraries such as sklearn,seaborn,matplotlib were used.
